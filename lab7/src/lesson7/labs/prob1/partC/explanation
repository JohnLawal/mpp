The removeDuplicates() method in EmployeeInfo uses an Employee object as the key in a HashMap.
During this process, a hashcode for the each Employee object will be created. Since the Employee
class did not Override the hashCode() method, different hashcodes will be generated even when the objects
have the same properties. This will therefore make the containsKey() method used in removeDuplicates() to 
return false even though a similar Employee was already added to the tracker.
