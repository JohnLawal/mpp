The implementation for override of the equals() method in Employee class is wrong.
There is no @Override annotation. The signature does not accept Object as parameter.
Therefore, although both lists are the same, the contains() method of List interface
used in the listsAreEqual() method of EmployeeInfo will make use of the equals() method 
of Object for Employee which will return false even when it should be true.
